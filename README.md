# Python based roblox script deobfuscator.
## Made with auto-py-to-exe (original luaminifier.py script which was used is in there aswell!)

# USAGE
**1. Download the whole zip folder, this way it downloads the .exe correctly aswell.**

**2. Execute the .exe as intended, select your input file, write your output file.**

**3. ENJOY!**

*ADDITIONAL FILES*
- testfile.py: Usage of chatgpt after deobfuscation (not done yet).
- luaminifier.py: Original file, executable (make sure to have your file that you want to deobfuscate be named `script.txt` and be in the same directory as the deobfuscator.)
- luaminifier.manual.py: Complimentary script for luaminifier.py or deobfuscator.exe. Can automatically or manually rename functions and variables to liking.
  
Made with AI, expect mistakes.
